# Cat or Dog Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. The goal is to achieve at least 90% accuracy. The dataset has separate folders for training and testing, each with images of cats and dogs.

## Project Components
- **Data:** Images of cats and dogs for training and testing.
- **Model:** A CNN with convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
- **Scripts:** Python code to load data, define the model, train it, and make predictions.

## Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Use `ImageDataGenerator` to load and augment the training data.
2. **Model Architecture:** Define the CNN with appropriate layers and activations.
3. **Training:** Compile the model and train with the training set.
4. **Predictions:** Test the model with a single image to classify it as cat or dog.

## Results
The model achieved a final accuracy of [XX]%. It can classify images as cats or dogs with a high level of confidence.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your environment.
2. Ensure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed.
3. Load the data, train the model, and run predictions.
